# secret-gallery

This is a small project I was doing during my free time, realy dirty no polished.

I was planing to keep this into a private repository on bitbucket (that's why the package name is org.bit...),
but then I decided to open source it.

What is this application?
- Basically it is a gallery for hide files with an pin, we import those files and save into the app files directory so no one can access it.
- Dirty code
